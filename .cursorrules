# Cursor Rules for AI Lecture Materials

## Audience Context

- **Target Audience**: Economics BS students with basic non-technical background
- **Writing Style**: Write clearly and simply. Avoid jargon. Explain technical concepts in plain language. But don't be verbose. 
- **Assumptions**: Students have minimal programming/tech background. Use analogies and simple explanations when introducing technical concepts
- **Tone**: Professional but accessible, encouraging, step-by-step guidance


## Documentation Style Guidelines

- **No emojis**: Do not use emojis in any documentation files (.md, .txt, etc.)
- **No em-dashes**: Use regular hyphens (-) instead of em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–)
- **Plain text formatting**: Keep documentation clean and professional without decorative characters

## When Editing Documentation

- Remove any emojis found in markdown files
- Replace em-dashes (—) with regular hyphens (-)
- Replace en-dashes (–) with regular hyphens (-)
- Maintain consistent, professional tone throughout
- Use simple, clear language appropriate for economics BS students without extensive tech background
