JetBlue Airways 
JetBlue, New York’s Hometown Airline, is a major carrier at JFK International Airport and a key player in the U.S. transcontinental market. Known for combining low fares with a premium customer experience, JetBlue relies on sophisticated revenue management systems to balance early, price-sensitive leisure demand with late, high-yield business travel. Industry studies show that effective use of analytics and AI in fare optimization can raise revenue by single to low double digits, while controlled overbooking helps offset typical airline no-show rates of 6% to 10%. Oversales, however, must be managed with precision. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the industry-wide rate of involuntary denied boardings was just 0.25 per 10,000 passengers in late 2024, highlighting the delicate balance between profitability and service reliability that lies at the heart of JetBlue’s operations.
The New York–San Jose Flight
Maria Oktopodaki, the head of revenue management at JetBlue, has been concerned about one particular flight between New York (JFK) and San Jose (SJC). The route is operated with an A321 with 200 seats and offers two fare classes: a full fare (FF), for $850, and a “super saver” (SS) fare, for $350. To qualify for the SS fare, customers must purchase at least 2 months in advance (before the flight date). In contrast, FF is very flexible, and is offered up until the date of the flight, if seats are still available. In fact, historically, the FF customers are almost exclusively business travelers, who always make last-minute purchases, and are not price-sensitive. Hence, it can be assumed, without loss of generality, that the airline prioritizes meeting the demand for SS fare first, and allocates any remaining seats to the demand for FF fare. 
 
Using historical data, Maria estimated that the mean demand for SS fares is roughly 130, and the mean demand for FF fares is roughly 55. She would like to build a model to guide her decisions. A key operational lever under her control is the “booking limit” for the SS fare, i.e., how many seats to make available to SS customers. Historically, that value was set at 120, but Maria is not sure that’s right. She knows that, the larger that limit is, the fewer seats she might have available for (higher-paying) FF customers.

Questions
Part I
1. Build a spreadsheet model that predicts the revenue for one JFK–SJC flight when the booking limit (for SS fare) is set to 120. [HINT: Here, you do not need to account for any parameter uncertainty; simply use the mean demand values. But you should build a model that is flexible enough to handle cases where some of the parameters, such as the demand for the various fares, may change.]
2. Using additional data, Maria has been able to estimate that the demand for SS fares actually follows a normal distribution, with mean 130 and standard deviation 45, and the demand for FF follows a normal distribution, with mean 55 and standard deviation 20. Update the model in Question 1 to predict the expected revenue (i.e., mean revenue) for one JFK–SJC flight when the booking limit for SS fare is set to 120. How does this number compare with the one you got in Question 1?
3. Modify the model in Question 2 so that SS and FF demands are positively correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.6. How do the mean and variance of revenue compare with the values in Question 2?
4. Using the model in Question 2, find the booking limit that maximizes the expected revenue for one JFK–SJC flight. Consider booking limit values between 40 and 160 in increments of 10. [HINT: You should define a Decision Cell, run decision table, and view results under “Decision Tables.”]
