Developing a New Wearable Device

Fitbit, Inc. is a wearable technology company headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company was founded in 2007 by James Park and Eric Friedman, with the goal of inspiring individuals to live healthier and more active lives. Fitbit specializes in fitness trackers that measure data such as the number of steps walked, quality of sleep, and heart rate. They have sold over 90 million devices, and the company is considered one of the leaders in the wearables market. 

This case focuses on decisions Fitbit faces in developing and releasing a new product that does much more than activity tracking. However, they have reasons to believe that some of their biggest competitors are also developing similar products. By making careful decisions about the product with the help of some modeling in Excel, Fitbit believes they can still dominate the market for this new type of device.

Pricing
One of the main decisions Fitbit faces is determining the price of their device. Based on historical sales of Fitbit devices, they know the price should be no less than $100, and no more than $400. By analyzing historical data, they have developed the following expected demand equation for pre-orders (the expected number of people who will pre-order the device, so as to have it shipped as soon as it is released), which depends on the price of the Fitbit device (Price):

Expected Demand (pre-order) = 208,000 – 502*Price

While this equation is accurate for most prices, they know demand will never be negative. 

Pre-Release Production
Producing more devices lowers the cost per device, but also increases the total time it takes for the devices to arrive from the manufacturer. The manufacturer gave Fitbit the information listed in Table 1 for the marginal production cost per device, as well as the total production time required. These critically depend on the number of devices produced. For example, if Fitbit wants to have 80,000 devices produced, they will pay $75.00 each for the first 50,000 devices, $55.00 each for the next 25,000 devices, and $40.00 each for the last 5,000 devices. 

Delivery time, on the other hand, is determined by the last device to be produced. For example, a production order of 80,000 would mean that ALL devices will be delivered after 11 weeks.  

Fitbit wants to release their device as soon as possible, since they expect their competitor to enter the market any day now. Therefore, they have decided to order the devices today, and they are debating what shipping date to announce to their customers (how many weeks from today). If the products arrive from the manufacturer by the announced shipping date, they can be shipped to the customers who have pre-ordered the device without any complications. However, for every additional week that the devices are delayed beyond the announced shipping date, Fitbit has decided to give each customer who has pre-ordered the device a $25 rebate. So, if they announce a shipping date of 8 weeks from today, but the devices take 9 weeks to be produced, Fitbit will give each customer a $25 rebate. If they take 10 weeks to be produced, Fitbit will give each customer a $50 rebate.

Questions

Part I

Build a spreadsheet model in Excel that predicts the profits for the new Fitbit device, when it prices the device at $250 and announces a shipping date of 9 weeks from today. (Your model should also work if the price varies, i.e., not hard coded for $250. )
[HINT: When computing the total cost and production time, think about how to avoid messy nested functions by using a table] 

Part II

Using a Data Table, find out what price Fitbit should charge for their device in order maximize profits? You may assume that the prices should stay within $100 and 400. [Consider prices between $100 and $400 in increments of $10]

Using a Two-Dimensional Data Table, find out how your optimal price Question 2 changes as you move the announced shipping date? [Consider prices between $100 and $400 in increments of $10, and announced shipping date between 4 and 15 weeks in increment of 1 week]
