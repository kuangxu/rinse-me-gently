# Rinse Me Gently: An Introductory AI & Python Workshop

> "Come, gentle night, come, loving black brow night, give me my Romeo."  
> — William Shakespeare, *Romeo and Juliet*, Act 3, Scene 2

This is a two part lecture focusing on introducing a basic Python workflow as well as LLM fine tuning to a relatively non-technical audience. 

## Repository Structure

### Part A: Setup & Introduction (`AI_With_Python_PartA`)
**Objective:** Establish a professional development environment.
*   Setting up Python and the Cursor IDE (or VS Code).
*   Understanding and configuring Virtual Environments.
*   Executing initial Python scripts.

**Start here to prepare your local environment for the workshop.**

### Part B: LLM Fine-Tuning (`AI_With_Python_PartB`) 
**Objective:** Execute a state-of-the-art AI workflow.
*   Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM).
*   Managing training data and pipelines.
*   Interacting with custom-trained models.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Download the Materials

**Option A: The Easy Way (Recommended)**
1.  Look for the green **Code** button near the top right of this page.
2.  Click it and select **Download ZIP**.
3.  Once downloaded, unzip the file (double-click it). You should now have a folder named `rinse_me_gently-main` (or similar) on your computer.

**Option B: The Developer Way (Git Clone)**
If you are already comfortable with Git, you can clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuangxu/rinse_me_gently.git
```

### Step 2: Start Part A
1.  Navigate to the `AI_With_Python_PartA` folder on GitHub (in your web browser).
2.  Click on `Part_A_Instructions.md` to view the instructions directly on GitHub.
3.  Follow the step-by-step guide inside to set up your environment.
   - *Note: The virtual environment will be created at the root level so it can be shared between Part A and Part B.*
   - *Tip: If you're using Cursor IDE, you can also open `.md` files locally and press `Cmd+Shift+V` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+V` (Windows/Linux) to render them in a preview pane.*
